Flexible Cropping Sequences
========================================
The previous tutorial section introduced how to represent predetermined crop rotations in APSIM.
However, whenever cropping system research aims to simulate likely farmer behaviour in a forward looking manner,
the simulation of a fixed, predetermined crop rotation is hardly realistic.
Instead, farm managers often have a couple of typical cropping strategies, between which they will shift quite flexibly based on changing context conditions.
For example, in south-east Queensland, farmers can flexibly change between summer- and winter-dominant cropping patterns based on seasonally changing water availability and soil moisture storage from preceding months.
Another driver of rapid shifts in crop choice can be pest outbreaks (such as the shift out of maize following the first appearance and spread of fall armyworm in Australia) 
or pronounced and sudden changes in price incentives (for example, as a consequence to the 30% tariff imposed on chickpea and lentil imports into India in 2017).

In this section, we will explore how to define such flexible cropping sequences that dynamically determine crop choice based on external conditions.


Case Study Context
----------------------------------------
This tutorial focusses on representing a flexible cropping strategy within the exemplary agro-ecological context of the *Darling Downs* growing region.
This production region in South-East Queensland (Australia) is characterised by two major crop growing periods, summer and winter.
The region is characterised by a summer-dominant rainfall pattern and most farmers correspondingly adopt predominantly a summer-dominant cropping strategy.
However, over the last two decades, the planted area of winter crops has steadily increased.
Many farmers have adopted highly climate-responsive, opportunistic cropping strategies, 
implementing high cropping intensity whenever adequate water resources are available, regardless of the season.
Evidence of this flexible alternation between summer- and winter-dominant cropping is visible even in aggregate government statistics on seasonal planted area across Queensland (`ABARES, 2024`_).

In the following, we will aim to represent such an opportunistic cropping strategy within the ``RotationManager`` of APSIM.
It is important to remember, that this scenario serves as an illustrative example only.
Our core focus is to demonstrate a workflow in APSIM that can readily be transferred to other agro-ecological settings and applications.
For example, in production regions where a wheat-dominant crop rotation is largely predetermined, such as in parts of Western Australia, 
there is little value in configuring a ``RotationManager`` that represents flexible crop choices.

In such contexts, the design logic presented in this tutorial can instead be applied to other dynamic aspects of the local cropping system, for example, 
simulating flexible soil management decisions rather than flexible crop choices. 
This could include, for instance, the occasional application of soil amendments such as lime when selected soil properties fall below specified thresholds.
