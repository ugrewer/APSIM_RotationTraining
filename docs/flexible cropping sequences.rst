Flexible Cropping Sequences
========================================
The previous tutorial section introduced how to represent predetermined crop rotations in APSIM.
However, whenever cropping system research aims to simulate likely farmer behaviour in a forward looking manner,
the simulation of a fixed, predetermined crop rotation is hardly realistic.
Instead, farm managers often have a couple of typical cropping strategies, between which they will shift quite flexibly based on changing context conditions.
For example, in south-east Queensland, farmers can flexibly change between summer- and winter-dominant cropping patterns based on seasonally changing water availability and soil moisture storage from preceding months.
Another driver of rapid shifts in crop choice can be pest outbreaks (such the first appearance and diffusion of fall armyworm), 
or strong and rapid changes in price incentives (such as the introduction of a 30% tarif on chickpea and lentil imports into India in 2017).

In this section, we will explore how to define such flexible cropping sequences that dynamically determine crop choice based on external conditions.
The scenario presented herein serves as an illustrative example only, with the demonstrated APSIM workflow being readily transferable to other agro-ecological settings and applications.
