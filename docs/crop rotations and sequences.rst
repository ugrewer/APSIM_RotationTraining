Crop Rotations and Sequences
========================================
When simulating crop production on a field over an extended period, 
the previous assumption of continuously cultivating a single crop with fixed management practices is rarely applicable. 
To represent predetermined crop rotations of multiple crops as well as highly flexible crop sequences, APSIM provides the ``RotationManager`` *model*. 
In the following, we will first have a look at the basic usage of the ``RotationManager`` *model*.
Subsequently, we will present various approaches for representing increasingly complex, user-specific crop rotation and sequencing scenarios.

Basic Overview of the Rotation Manager
----------------------------------------
In the following section, we will develop a simple crop rotation scenario in APSIM from the ground up.
As starting point, we will again utilise the earlier simulation of continuous Sorghum in Dalby: 
`Sorghum_continuous_carryOver.apsimx <_APSIM_code/Sorghum_continuous_carryOver/Sorghum_continuous_carryOver.apsimx>`_.
Please save the file under the new name *"CropRotation_basic.apsimx"* and also rename the simulation *node* from *"Continuous_Sorghum"* to *"CropRotation_basic"*.
To add the ``RotationManager`` *model* to the simulation tree, right-click on the ``Paddock`` *node*, click on ``Add model...``, 
expand the  ``Management`` folder, and double click on ``RotationManager`` 
(alternatively, you can drag-and-drop the ``RotationManager`` onto the ``Paddock`` *node*).

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_addingRotationManager.png
   :alt: Adding Rotation Manager
   :width: 100%

   Adding the Rotation Manager model to the simulation tree.

The ``RotationManager`` consists of a graphical bubble chart with which you can represent a crop rotation.
For our first example, we will aim at generating the crop rotation "Sorghum-Fallow-Mungbean-Fallow".
The crop rotation exclusively comprises summer crops and is rigidly predefined, 
without accommodating alternative crop choices in response to varying environmental conditions.
At the starting point, the ``RotationManager`` is blank.
To add your first crop, right-click on the black canvas and select *"Add node"*.
Rename the *node* (i.e., bubble) to "Sorghum".
In the right-hand bottom corner, you may also add a further description (optional) and change the *node* colour.
For example, we selected a colour that is similar to the colour of sorghum heads. 
Please also select the tick boxes *"Top Level"* and *"Verbose Mode"*.
Subsequently, repeat these steps three further times to generate a total of four *nodes* for each plot occupation in the crop rotation.
Please drag the *nodes* on the canvas into the order of the intended rotatation "Sorghum-Fallow-Mungbean-Fallow".
Further, do not name several *nodes* identically (e.g., avoid that two *nodes* are called "Fallow") as this would prevent us from uniquely identifying to which *node* we are referring to later.
To easily distinguish between the two fallows, we name them Fallow_postSG for the fallow following sorghum, and Fallow_postMB for the fallow following mungbean.
Your bubble chart should now look similar to one of the below figures.
There are many ways how you can graphically organise the bubble chart.
Two common ways are to structure it as row sequence or circle.

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_BubbleChart_basic_row.png
   :alt: BubbleChart_basic_row
   :width: 100%

   Bubble chart of a simple crop rotation - organised as row sequence.

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_BubbleChart_basic_circle.png
   :alt: BubbleChart_basic_circle
   :width: 100%

   Bubble chart of a simple crop rotation - organised as circle.

While the *nodes* represent the different possible field occupations, the next step is to connect the *nodes* with arcs.
Arcs define the transitions the we request APSIM to simulate.
Please add a single arc each for the desired transitions of our rotation plan "Sorghum-Fallow-Mungbean-Fallow".
For this, right-click on a *node* and select ``Add arc``, drag the arc to the *node* it shall transition to,
and click on the *node* to lock-in the arc.
Optionally, you can rename the arcs to more descriptive labels.
For example, below we chose the labels "Enter Sorghum", "Exit Sorghum", "Enter Mungbean", "Exit Mungbean".
The resulting bubble chart should look similar to the following:

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_BubbleChart_nodesWithArcs.png
   :alt: BubbleChart_nodesWithArcs
   :width: 100%

   Addition of arcs to bubble chart.

The above bubble chart gives us the basic crop rotation structure that we will work with for this example.
It exactly identifies in which sequence crops and fallows will be simulated.
When clicking on any of the arcs, you will see that these transition rules require two arguments:

- **Conditions** that specify under which circumstances the simulation will transition from the starting node of the arc to the ending node of the arc.
- **Actions** that specify which activities are carried out as part of the transition.

At this stage, we did not yet specify any conditions and actions, which is the focus of the next subsection. 


Transitioning between Plot States
----------------------------------------
To have a clean starting point for the definition of crop management rules, 
please first delete the current ``Manager folder`` from the simulation tree (under the ``Paddock`` *node*).
Let us now utilise one of the principles we mentioned earlier:
Instead of writing **C# code** from scratch, 
we can use scripts from both the *Management toolbox* as well as example *APSIMX files* that are distributed with the software as our starting point.
For this, navigate to ``Home`` > ``Open an example`` and opent the example file *"Rotation.apsimx"*.
This is an example crop rotation file that is distributed with APSIM and that you may want to explore at your own time in more detail.
Here, we will copy a useful script that manages crop sowing and harvesting and use it within our simulation.
To copy the script, expand the simulation tree and navigate to ``Crop Pasture`` > ``Field``, copy the ``OatsManager``, 
and paste it into the ``Paddock`` *node* of our simulation *"CropRotation_basic"*.
As we will need two of these *manager* scripts, paste it a second time into the ``Paddock`` *node*.
Rename the manger *nodes* to ``SowHarvest_sorghum`` and ``SowHarvest_mungbean``.

For fertilisation, we can instead continue to use our previous *manager* script.
Please copy the ``Fertilise at sowing`` script, so that we again have two versions of it.
Rename the *managers* to ``Fert_sorghum`` and ``Fert_mungbean``.
The resulting simulation tree should now look similar to the following:

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_SimTreeWithManagers.png
   :alt: SimTreeWithManagers
   :width: 50%

   Simulation tree with updated *manager* scripts.

Copying existing manger scripts saved us a lot of coding work.
While this gives us the correct structure of crop management actions that we want to conduct,
we still need to ensure that the parameter values are all as we want them.
For this, we will step through each *manager* script and modify all necessary parameter values.

Let us start with ``SowHarvest_sorghum``:

- Set the *Crop to manage* to *Sorghum* by selecting it from the drop down list.
- As we copied the crop *manager* from a winter crop (oats), the sowing window is unreasonable. Update its start and end date to the values we previously used for Sorghum in Dalby (start: 1-nov; end: 10-jan).
- For the required soil moisture and rainfall conditions, we also insert the values from our previous sorghum simulation in Dalby (Min. ESW: 120mm; Acc. Rain: 50mm; Rain duration: 7 days).
- Ensure that the *"Must sow?"* tickbox is unticked. If ticked, the script enforces that a crop is sown at the end of the sowing window, even if sowing conditions are not satisfied.
- Update the sowing properties to mirror the earlier parameters used for simulating sorghum in Dalby (Cultivar: Buster; Sowing depth: 30mm; Row spacing: 750mm; Plant population: 10 plants/m2).


Simple modifications of C# scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you inspect once more the earlier *manager* script from the continuous sorghum simulation (*Sorghum_continuous_carryOver.apsimx*),
you will see that there were some more sorghum-specific parameters in the *manager* script.
These were *"skip row configuration"*, *"tillering method"*, and *"fertile tiller number"*.
However, these sorghum-specific parameters are not included in the crop-generic *manager* script that we are using here.
This provides us with a good opportunity to explore another core capability required to flexibly generate APSIM simulations: 
modifying the **C# code** of *manager* scripts.

Let us first explore the background **C# code** that is generating the *manager* user interface which we have been modifying.
For this, select ``SowHarvest_sorghum`` in the simulation tree, and then click on the ``Script`` tab.


.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_CsharpScript_Exp.png
   :alt: CsharpScript_Exp
   :width: 80%

   APSIM management script *"SowHarvest_sorghum"* written in C# (prior to any changes).

The above displays the first parts of the **C# code** in the ``SowHarvest_sorghum`` *manager* script that you can fully scroll through on your own screen.
If you have little past exposure or own experience with programming languages, the **C# code** may not mean much to you â€” and that is perfectly fine.
It is important to note, that a whole lot of APSIM modelling can be achieved without modifying any **C# code**.
What we are exploring here is to make light modifications to existing code which does not require a thorough understanding of *C#* nor an advanced knowledge of the code base of APSIM.
Even if you never plan to conduct such code modifications yourself, this section provides you with a high level understanding of the programmatic functioning of the APSIM user interface, which will be useful by itself.

For those interested, let us have a brief conceptual overview of the ``SowHarvest_sorghum`` *manager* script (otherwise, feel free to skip this paragraph).
This *C#* script is a custom APSIM management script inside the *Models* namespace - a logical grouping of related classes. 
The *using* statements at the top import external APSIM and .NET libraries, allowing access to components such as soils, weather, plants, and utility functions. 
The *Script* class itself inherits from APSIMâ€™s base *Model* class and implements the *IStructureDependency* interface. 
Inside the class, linked components (e.g., *Clock*, *Soil*, *Crop*) are automatically connected to other simulation modules. 
The script subscribes to simulation events like *StartOfSimulation* or *DoManagement*, 
and defines methods and properties that determine when to sow or harvest a crop. 
Overall, the code provides a structured way to embed dynamic crop management logic directly into an APSIM simulation.

What we want to do now is to modify the above script so that it is able to accept values 
for the Sorghum-specific parameters *"skip row configuration"*, *"tillering method"*, and *"fertile tiller number"*.
Thereby, these variables need to be specified in a way that is interpretable by APSIM (i.e, corresponding to predefined classes in APSIM).
This can be achieved by consulting the `APSIM documentation for sorghum <https://docs.apsim.info/validation/Sorghum>`_ as well as the publicly available `APSIM Source Code <https://github.com/APSIMInitiative/ApsimX>`_ for the sorghum model.
Instead, let us here first learn another shortcut that does not require much understanding of **C# code**:
Selecting a suitable existing *manager* script, and copying the relevant **C# code** into our target *manager* script.

In the previously utilised *manager* script from the continuous sorghum simulation (*Sorghum_continuous_carryOver.apsimx*),
we know that the three sorghum-specific variables are defined in a correct manner.
In the user interface, when clicking on the *manager* script ``SowingRule``  we can easily see the three variables being referred to as follows:

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_SorghumParamUserInterface.png
   :alt: SorghumParamUserInterface
   :width: 50%

When we then navigate to the ``Script`` tab, we can search for the same keywords and find the corresponding **C# code**.
Specifically, what we are after are the highlighted segments below:

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_SorghumParamCSharpCode.png
   :alt: SorghumParamCSharpCode
   :width: 80%

Let us copy the highlighted code and paste it into the *manager* script ``SowHarvest_sorghum``, specifically after the code segment:

.. code-block:: csharp
    :caption: C# code section in the manager script *"SowHarvest_sorghum"*, after which sorghum-specific code should be added

    public double Population { get; set; }

The updated **C# code** should look like the following.
The code additions can be found in lines 58-73.
The remainder of the code remained unchanged from the template that we used.

                MonthlyHarvestedWt = (  Structure.FindChild<IModel>("Grain", relativeTo: (INodeModel)Crop) as ReproductiveOrgan).Wt;
                Crop.Harvest();
                Crop.EndCrop();
            }

            {
                MonthlyHarvestedWt = 0;
            }
        }
    }

In the thus modified *manager* script ``SowHarvest_sorghum`` we can switch back from the ``Script`` tab to the ``Parameters`` tab.
Now, we should be able to modify the three target parameters *"skip row configuration"*, *"tillering method"*, and *"fertile tiller number"* to their desired values:
solid row configuration, fixed tillering method, and zero fertile tillers.

The above provided an example of a work routing that implements minor changes to a *manager* script, without thorough knowledge or skills in *C#* programming.


Updating the remaining manager scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
With the *manager* script ``SowHarvest_sorghum`` being finalised, we still need to update the remaining three *manager* scripts.
The remaining updates are much simpler.
Let us continue with ``SowHarvest_mungbean``.
When clicking on the drop-down list *"Crop to manage"* we see that the only choice is sorghum, while mungbean is not available.
In fact, when you look at the simulation tree, you see that ``Sorghum`` is the only crop model that we have included in our simulation.
To add the mungbean crop model, right-click on ``Paddock`` *node*, select ``Add model...``, 
expand the ``PMF`` folder (for: Plant Modelling Framework; `Brown et al., 2014`_), and double-click on the ``Mungbean`` crop model 
(or alternatively drag-and-drop the ``Mungbean`` crop model onto the simulation tree under ``Paddock``).
The resulting simulation tree should now look similar to the following:

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_AddedMungbeanModel.png
   :alt: AddedMungbeanModel
   :width: 35%

   Simulation tree with added *Mungbean* crop model.

When we now navigate again to the *manager* script ``SowHarvest_mungbean``, you are able to select *Mungbean* from the drop-down list as the target crop.
Further modifications that we need to conduct to ``SowHarvest_mungbean`` are:

- Update the sowing window start and end dates to desired values for mungbean around Dalby (start: 1-oct; end: 30-dec).
- Update the soil moisture and rainfall conditions required for sowing (in. ESW: 120mm; Acc. Rain: 50mm; Rain duration: 7 days).
- Again ensure that the *"Must sow?"* tickbox is unticked.
- Select a set of desired sowing properties for mungbean around Dalby (Cultivar: CeleraII; Sowing depth: 40mm; Row spacing: 500mm; Plant population: 25 plants/m2).

The final *manager* script ``SowHarvest_mungbean`` should look similar to the following:

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_MungbeanManager.png
   :alt: MungbeanManager
   :width: 50%

   Simulation tree with added *Mungbean* crop model.

Next, we select the *manager* script ``Fert_sorghum``.
Here, we can see that all values are already as we intend them to be and no further changes are needed.
Instead, when selecting  ``Fert_mungbean``, we see that the target crop is still blank and we have to select *Mungbean* from the drop-down list.
Now, all manager scripts have been finalised.


Specifying transition rules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Let us now return to the ``RotationManager`` *node* and see if we can advance the question of how to transition between the various plot states.
After selecting the arc *"Enter Sorghum"*, we see that the **"Conditions"** and **"Actions"** fields in the bottom right-hand corner are still blank.
As we remember, we defined a set of conditions for when we want a crop to be sown in the *manager* scripts ``SowHarvest_sorghum`` and ``SowHarvest_mungbean``.
Here, we want to link to those *manager* scripts to let them impose their conditions for sowing.
For this, we click into the **"Conditions"** box and add a reference to the *manager* script by typing ``[SowHarvest_sorghum]``.
When you add a dot (.) after this reference, IntelliSense displays a drop-down list of available properties and methods.
Here, we are interested to access the ``Script`` property, that we have modified earlier ourselves.
After adding another dot (.) we can then access the sowing condition that we defined in the **C# code** that was called ``CanSow``.

Next, we want to specify the **"Actions"** that shall be conducted if this condition is fulfilled.
For this we equivalently click into the **"Conditions"** box, again add the reference to the *manager* script by typing ``[SowHarvest_sorghum]``,
append a dot (.) and the ``Script`` property, append another dot (.) and select the action ``SowCrop()``.

The completed box of **"Conditions"** and **"Actions"** should look like the following:

.. figure:: _static/APSIMscreenshot_EnterSorghumTransitions.png
   :alt: EnterSorghumTransitions
   :width: 50%

   Transition rules for the arc *"Enter Sorghum"*.

In a similar fashion, we have to step through all remaining three transition rules. 
For this, please click on each arc and select the suitable conditions and actions by using IntelliSense.
Once you have completed this task, you can compare your choices to the correct **C# code** below.

.. code-block:: csharp
    :caption: List of transition rules of the RotationManager

    //// Arc: Enter Sorghum
    // Conditions
    [SowHarvest_sorghum].Script.CanSow
    // Actions
    [SowHarvest_sorghum].Script.SowCrop()

    //// Arc: Exit Sorghum
    // Conditions
    [SowHarvest_sorghum].Script.CanHarvest
    // Actions
    [SowHarvest_sorghum].Script.HarvestCrop()

    //// Arc: Enter Mungbean
    // Conditions
    [SowHarvest_mungbean].Script.CanSow
    // Actions
    [SowHarvest_mungbean].Script.SowCrop()

    //// Arc: Exit Mungbean
    // Conditions
    [SowHarvest_mungbean].Script.CanHarvest
    // Actions
    [SowHarvest_mungbean].Script.HarvestCrop()

With this, we have completed the setup of a basic Rotation Manager model in APSIM.


Crop-Soil interaction
----------------------------------------
Each crop type comes with its own ability and constraints in accessing water.
As we started out with an example *APSIMX file* that only focussed on Sorghum, we currently only have specifications for the Plant Available Water Capacity (PAWC) of Sorghum.
To inspect the specific values, please expand the *Soil node* ``HRS``, then expand the ``Physical`` *node*, and select ``SorghumSoil``.
Here, you can see the specific values for: 

- Crop-specific soil water extraction limit (*Lower Limit*; LL). You may also know this variable under the terms *Crop Lower Limit*. Below this value, the crop cannot extract water (even though some water is still physically present in the soil profile). Please note that this is different from *Lower Limit 15* (LL15), also known as *Wilting Point*, which indicates the soil water content at 15 bar suction (which is exclusively soil-specific, but not crop-specific).
- Water Extraction Coefficient (KL). The KL factor specifies the maximum fraction of available water (above LL15) that a plantâ€™s roots can extract from a soil layer per day under non-limiting conditions. It reflects both root and soil properties (e.g., root density and soil hydraulic conductivity, etc.).
- Root Exploration Factor (XF). The XF factor limits root penetration in a soil layer, describing the fraction of the layer accessible to roots. At XF==1, roots can fully explore the layer, while at XF==0, roots cannot grow into that layer. Values in between reflect partial restriction (e.g., due to physical or chemical constraints).

Please note that the general soil physical properties can be seen and modified under the parent *node* ``Physical``.
Since we introduced mungbean into this simulation, we have to generate a similar ``MungbeanSoil`` *node*.
For this, let us copy ``SorghumSoil`` and rename the copy to ``MungbeanSoil``.
Values of crop-soil interactions are usually experimentally determined and should not be specified out of thin air.
However, as we are only aiming here at demonstrating the technical handling of APSIM, we only conduct some examplary changes to these parameter values for the sake of illustration.
Here, we assume that mungbean would be characterised by higher LL values, since mungbean has a shallower root system than sorghum's deep, fibrous roots.
We also assume that KL values for mungbean are lower than for sorghum, meaning that the extraction rate of mungbean roots is lower.
Please manually update the *LL* and *KL* values in ``MungbeanSoil`` to the following:
