Continuous Cropping of a Single Crop
=====
The most classical starting point in the learning and usage of crop models is the simulation of a single crop cycle, from sowing to harvest.
For instance, when crop models are used to simulate the observed crop growth from agricultural field trials, 
each trial treatment is typically represented by simulating a single crop cycle. 
This is the most common approach even when the experimental data come from continuous, multi-year trials on identical plots.
Such crop model simulations of single crop cycles are typically used for crop model calibration and evaluation. 
Once calibrated, crop model simulations can be employed for more analytical purposes, 
such as assessing the impact of different management practices or changing environmental conditions (e.g., climate change)
 on crop growth, crop yield, and further outcome indicators.) 

This section builds on this classical starting point by demonstrating how to set up and run a simple long-term simulation of a single crop that is grown continuously over multiple years.
Thereby, we primarily consider the case of simulating the continuous carry-over of soil water and nutrient states between subsequent crop cycles. 
For comparison, we also briefly consider the alternative case of resetting soil water and nutrient states at the beginning of each crop cycle.


Continuous simulation of a single crop with state carry-over
-------------------------------------
Extending the simulation of a single crop cycle to the repeated, continuous growth of the same crop over multiple years can easily be achieved in APSIM.
It predominently entails:

- Extending the start and end dates of the simulation in the clock-node of the simulation tree to the desired multi-year period.
- Specifying rule-based management actions - such as for sowing, fertilisation, and irrigation - based on desired triggers, such as fixed dates, or more commonly, soil water and precipitation thresholds.

For instance, consider the two widely used example APSIM files ``Sorghum.apsimx`` and ``Wheat.apsimx`` included with the APSIM installation,
which you can access by selecting "Open an Example" from the top toolbar of the APSIM graphical user interface (GUI).

Instead of simulating the respective crop over a single season, both files simulate continuous crop growth over a period of 100 years, from 1900 to 2000.
You can explore both files and the simulation results by opening and running them in your own time.

To better understand the steps and details of continuous simulations of single crops, we will utilise a modified version of the file ``Sorghum.apsimx`` as a starting point.
It can be accessed here (for users that would like to follow along, which is highly recommended): `Sorghum_continuous_carryOver.apsimx <_APSIM_code/Sorghum_continuous_carryOver/Sorghum_continuous_carryOver.apsimx>`_

This example file simulates sorghum in Dalby, (Queensland, Australia). However, instead of simulating exclusively a single crop cycle, from sowing to harvest,
the simulation runs continuously from its **start date** on 1/01/1985 to its **end date** on 31/12/1999, covering a total of 15 years.
In the simulation tree structure shown on the left-hand side of the APSIM GUI, you can inspect these values by navigating to
the ``Clock`` node.

A core aspect of continuous simulations is to specify the timing of all core management actions.
The most simple option is the specification of fixed dates. 
This can be a suitable choice for thought experiments, such as the analysis of consistently planting very early or late in the season.
However, the more common choice for continuous simulations is to define the timing of management actions based on state-variables reaching certain thresholds.
This could refer to a minimum level of soil water content, a cumulative rainfall threshold, a certain crop developmental stage being reached, or a time period elapsed since the last management action (e.g., to emulate on-farm labour constaints).
When considering the example at hand, the **SowingRule** is specified via a *manager script*. 
When clicking on the corresponding node in the simulation tree, you can see that sorghum is sown if the following criteria are fulfilled:

- The date falls within the sowing window from 1st November to 10th January.
- The extractable soil water exceeds 120 mm.
- In a 7-day period preceding the date, the cumulative rainfall exceeds 50 mm.

As always in APSIM, you can see that many pre-defined function are available through predefined *manager scripts*.
You can see a range of alternative sowing rules by clicking on ``Home`` > ``Management toolbox`` > ``Plant``.

While these predefined *manager scripts* provide many functionalities, APSIM transparently exposes the underlying **C# code** under the ``Script`` tab.
Instead of using predefined *manager scripts*, this easily allows users to write their own customised rules for management actions.
For users not familiar with C#, the predefined *manager scripts* are useful starting points, that allow sub-elements to be modified or removed as needed.

Generally, when working with APSIM, it is useful to remember that the GUI is meant as an aid to conducting crop modelling with APSIM.
However, for users that prefer to utilise **Code Editors** (such as VS Code, Sublime Text, etc.), 
the simulation tree that is visualised by the APSIM GUI can also directly be edited via a text editor, 
as it is simply a representation of an underlying JSON file.
When you open the current example APSIM file `Sorghum_continuous_carryOver.apsimx <_APSIM_code/Sorghum_continuous_carryOver/Sorghum_continuous_carryOver.apsimx>`_ in a text editor, it looks like this:

Example: Basic Sphinx project for Read the Docs
-------------------------------------

.. image:: https://readthedocs.org/projects/example-sphinx-basic/badge/?version=latest
    :target: https://example-sphinx-basic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest
    :alt: Documentation Status

.. This README.rst should work on Github and is also included in the Sphinx documentation project in docs/ - therefore, README.rst uses absolute links for most things so it renders properly on GitHub

This example shows a basic Sphinx project with Read the Docs. You're encouraged to view it to get inspiration and copy & paste from the files in the source code. If you are using Read the Docs for the first time, have a look at the official `Read the Docs Tutorial <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/index.html>`__.

üìö `docs/ <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/>`_
    A basic Sphinx project lives in ``docs/``. All the ``*.rst`` make up sections in the documentation.
‚öôÔ∏è `.readthedocs.yaml <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/.readthedocs.yaml>`_
    Read the Docs Build configuration is stored in ``.readthedocs.yaml``.
‚öôÔ∏è `docs/conf.py <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/conf.py>`_
    Both the configuration and the folder layout follow Sphinx default conventions. You can change the `Sphinx configuration values <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html>`_ in this file
üìç `docs/requirements.txt <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/requirements.txt>`_ and `docs/requirements.in <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/requirements.in>`_
    Python dependencies are `pinned <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/reproducible-builds.html>`_ (uses `pip-tools <https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_). Make sure to add your Python dependencies to ``requirements.txt`` or if you choose `pip-tools <https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, edit ``docs/requirements.in`` and remember to run ``pip-compile docs/requirements.in``.
üí° `docs/api.rst <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/api.rst>`_
    By adding our example Python module ``lumache`` in the reStructuredText directive ``:autosummary:``, Sphinx will automatically scan this module and generate API docs.
üí° `docs/usage.rst <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/docs/usage.rst>`_
    Sphinx can automatically extract API documentation directly from Python modules, using for instance the ``:autofunction:`` directive.
üí° `lumache.py <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/lumache.py>`_
    API docs are generated for this example Python module - they use *docstrings* directly in the documentation, notice how this shows up in the rendered documentation.
üî¢ Git tags versioning
    We use a basic versioning mechanism by adding a git tag for every release of the example project. All releases and their version numbers are visible on `example-sphinx-basic.readthedocs.io <https://example-sphinx-basic.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.
üìú `README.rst <https://github.com/readthedocs-examples/example-sphinx-basic/blob/main/README.rst>`_

Example Project usage
---------------------

This project has a standard Sphinx layout which is built by Read the Docs almost the same way that you would build it locally (on your own laptop!).

You can build and view this documentation project locally - we recommend that you activate `a local Python virtual environment first <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/#creating-a-virtual-environment>`_:

.. code-block:: console

    # Install required Python dependencies (Sphinx etc.)
    pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

    # Enter the Sphinx project
    cd docs/
    
    # Run the raw sphinx-build command
    sphinx-build -M html . _build/


You can also build the documentation locally with ``make``:

.. code-block:: console

    # Enter the Sphinx project
    cd docs/
    
    # Build with make
    make html
    
    # Open with your preferred browser, pointing it to the documentation index page
    firefox _build/html/index.html


Using the example in your own project
-------------------------------------

If you are new to Read the Docs, you may want to refer to the `Read the Docs User documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/>`_.

If you are copying this code in order to get started with your documentation, you need to:

#. place your ``docs/`` folder alongside your Python project. If you are starting a new project, you can adapt the `pyproject.toml` example configuration.
#. use your existing project repository or create a new repository on Github, GitLab, Bitbucket or another host supported by Read the Docs
#. copy ``.readthedocs.yaml`` and the ``docs/`` folder into your project.
#. customize all the files, replacing example contents.
#. add your own Python project, replacing the ``pyproject.toml`` configuration and ``lumache.py`` module.
#. rebuild the documenation locally to see that it works.
#. *finally*, register your project on Read the Docs, see `Importing Your Documentation <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/import-guide.html>`_.
